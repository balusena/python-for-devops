# Python Loops(for and while)

Loops are a fundamental concept in programming, and they allow you to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. In Python, 
there are two primary types of loops: "for" and "while."

## 1.For Loop
The "for" loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a set of statements
for each item in the sequence. The loop continues until all items in the sequence have been processed.

**Syntax:**

```
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to be executed for each item in the sequence
```

**Example:**

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**Output:**

```
apple
banana
cherry
```

In this example, the loop iterates over the "fruits" list, and in each iteration, the "fruit" variable takes on the value
of the current item in the list.

## 2.While Loop
The "while" loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's often used when you
don't know in advance how many times the loop should run.

**Syntax:**

```
while condition:
    # Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
```

**Example:**

```
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
3
4
```
In this example, the "while" loop continues to execute as long as the "count" is less than 5. The "count" variable is 
incremented in each iteration.

## 3.Loop Control Statements (break and continue)
Loop control statements are used to modify the behavior of loops, providing greater control and flexibility during iteration.
In Python, two primary loop control statements are "break" and "continue."

### 1.`break` Statement
The "break" statement is used to exit the loop prematurely. It can be applied to both "for" and "while" loops, allowing 
you to terminate the loop when a particular condition is met.

**Example:**

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    if number == 3:
        break
    print(number)
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
```

In this example, the loop stops when it encounters the number 3.

### 2.`continue` Statement
The "continue" statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next one. It can be used 
in both "for" and "while" loops, enabling you to bypass certain iterations based on a condition.

**Example:**

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    if number == 3:
        continue
    print(number)
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
4
5
```
In this example, the loop skips the iteration where the number is 3 and continues with the next iteration.

## 4.Practice Exercise - Automating Log File Analysis

### 1.Introduction
In this practice exercise, we use a "for" loop to automate the analysis of a log file and identify lines containing the
word "error." This demonstrates how loops can be used to process data and extract relevant information efficiently.

**Example:**

```
log_file = [
   "INFO: Operation successful",
   "ERROR: File not found",
   "DEBUG: Connection established",
   "ERROR: Database connection failed",
]

for line in log_file:
   if "ERROR" in line:
       print(line)
```

**Output:**

```
ERROR: File not found
ERROR: Database connection failed
```
In this exercise, the loop iterates through the "log_file" list and prints lines containing the word "ERROR."

## 5.For Loop DevOps use-cases

1. **Server Provisioning and Configuration:**

DevOps engineers use "for" loops when provisioning multiple servers or virtual machines with the same configuration. For
example, when setting up monitoring agents on multiple servers:

```
servers=("server1" "server2" "server3")
for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
    configure_monitoring_agent "$server"
done
```

2. **Deploying Configurations to Multiple Environments:**

When deploying configurations to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production), DevOps engineers can 
use a "for" loop to apply the same configuration changes to each environment:
      
```
environments=("dev" "staging" "prod")
for env in "${environments[@]}"; do
    deploy_configuration "$env"
done
```

3. **Backup and Restore Operations:**

Automating backup and restore operations is a common use case. DevOps engineers can use "for" loops to create backups for
multiple databases or services and later restore them as needed.

```
databases=("db1" "db2" "db3")
for db in "${databases[@]}"; do
    create_backup "$db"
done
```

4. **Log Rotation and Cleanup:**

DevOps engineers use "for" loops to manage log files, rotate logs, and clean up older log files to save disk space.

```
log_files=("app.log" "access.log" "error.log")
for log_file in "${log_files[@]}"; do
    rotate_and_cleanup_logs "$log_file"
done
```

5. **Monitoring and Reporting:**

In scenarios where you need to gather data or perform checks on multiple systems, a "for" loop is handy. For example, monitoring server resources across multiple machines:

```
servers=("server1" "server2" "server3")
for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
    check_resource_utilization "$server"
done
```

6. **Managing Cloud Resources:**

When working with cloud infrastructure, DevOps engineers can use "for" loops to manage resources like virtual machines, 
databases, and storage across different cloud providers.

```
instances=("instance1" "instance2" "instance3")
for instance in "${instances[@]}"; do
    resize_instance "$instance"
done
```

## 6.While Loop DevOps Usecases

DevOps engineers often use "while" loops in various real-time use cases to automate, monitor, and manage infrastructure 
and deployments. Here are some practical use cases from a DevOps engineer's perspective:

1. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline:**

DevOps engineers often use "while" loops in CI/CD pipelines to monitor the deployment status of applications. They can 
create a "while" loop that periodically checks the status of a deployment or a rolling update until it completes 
successfully or fails. For example, waiting for a certain number of pods to be ready in a Kubernetes deployment:

```
while kubectl get deployment/myapp | grep -q 0/1; do
    echo "Waiting for myapp to be ready..."
    sleep 10
done
```

2. **Provisioning and Scaling Cloud Resources:**

When provisioning or scaling cloud resources, DevOps engineers may use "while" loops to wait for the resources to be fully
provisioned and ready. For instance, waiting for an Amazon EC2 instance to become available:

```
while ! aws ec2 describe-instance-status --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 | grep -q "running"; do
    echo "Waiting for the EC2 instance to be running..."
    sleep 10
done
```

3. **Log Analysis and Alerting:**

DevOps engineers can use "while" loops to continuously monitor logs for specific events or errors and trigger alerts when
a certain condition is met. For example, tailing a log file and alerting when an error is detected:

```
while true; do
    if tail -n 1 /var/log/app.log | grep -q "ERROR"; then
       send_alert "Error detected in the log."
    fi
    sleep 5
done
```

4. **Database Replication and Data Synchronization:**

DevOps engineers use "while" loops to monitor database replication and ensure data consistency across multiple database
instances. The loop can check for replication lag and trigger corrective actions when necessary.

```
while true; do
    replication_lag=$(mysql -e "SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G" | grep "Seconds_Behind_Master" | awk '{print $2}')
    if [ "$replication_lag" -gt 60 ]; then
        trigger_data_sync
    fi
    sleep 60
done
```

5. **Service Health Monitoring and Auto-Recovery:**

DevOps engineers can use "while" loops to continuously check the health of services and automatically trigger recovery 
actions when services become unhealthy.

```
while true; do
    if ! check_service_health; then
        restart_service
    fi
    sleep 30
done
```
